# MachineLearning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intellihence and computer science which focuses on the use of the data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn,gradually improving accuracy.

# Machine Learning Flow
Collect Data  --> Clean and prepare Data --> Decide Machine Learning Model --> Train Machine Learning Model --> Test Model Outcome --> Finetune Model Outcome --> Use Final Model
